---
## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose Â 

---
  
To validate **High Availability (HA)** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)** by simulating failures in the primary region and ensuring Routeâ€¯53 correctly fails over to the secondary region. Tests also confirm that Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) and Application Load Balancers (ALBs) behave as expected.

## âœ… Test Steps

---

### 1. **EC2 + ASG Self-Healing** Â 

- **Action:** Stop both EC2 instances in the Mumbai region while ASG is active. Â 

- **Why:** To confirm that the ASG detects the failure and automatically launches a replacement instances. Â 

- **Validation:** Â 

Â  - ALB health check remains healthy. Â 

Â  - Traffic continues without interruption. Â 

Â  - New EC2 instances joins the target group automatically. Â 
  
---
### 2. **Regional Failover (Mumbai â†’ Virginia)** Â 

- **Action:** Â 

Â  1. Scale down the Mumbai ASG to **min=0, desired=0**. Â 

Â  2. After scaling down, **manually stop all remaining EC2 instances** in Mumbai. Â 

- **Why:** This ensures the ASG does not replace instances during the test, and the region is fully unavailable â€” simulating a real outage. Â 

- **Validation:** Â 

Â  - Mumbai ALB becomes unhealthy. Â 

Â  - Routeâ€¯53 detects the failure and reroutes traffic to the Virginia ALB. Â 

Â  - Users continue to access the application from the secondary region. Â 

---
### 3. **Failback (Virginia â†’ Mumbai)** Â 

- **Action:** Â 

Â  1. Scale the Mumbai ASG back up to **desired=2**. Â 

Â  2. Allow EC2 instances to launch and register with the ALB. Â 

- **Why:** To restore the primary region and validate that traffic can shift back once it is healthy. Â 

- **Validation:** Â 

Â  - Mumbai ALB health checks pass. Â 

Â  - Routeâ€¯53 routes traffic back to Mumbai. Â 

Â  - Application continues serving without errors. Â 


---
## ðŸ“Š Validation Summary Â 
  ---

- **ASG Behavior:** Replaces failed instances when enabled. Â 

- **Regional Failover:** Requires ASG scaled to 0 and EC2s stopped to simulate a true outage. Â 

- **Routeâ€¯53:** Correctly switches traffic between regions during failover and failback. Â
